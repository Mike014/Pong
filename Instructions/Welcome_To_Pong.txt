Welcome to Pong
Prepare for a fast-paced challenge! In this classic arcade experience, your goal is to defend your side and outscore your opponent. 
Be careful: the longer a rally lasts, the faster the ball will travel.

Controls

Paddle Movement Control your paddle's vertical position to block the ball.

- Up: Press the W key or the Up Arrow.

- Down: Press the S key or the Down Arrow.

System Controls

Game Rules
- Scoring: A point is awarded to you if the ball passes your opponent's paddle and crosses the boundary.

- Winning the Match: The first player to reach 5 points is declared the winner.

- The Difficulty Multiplier: Every time the ball hits a paddle, its speed increases. This makes long rallies intense and requires quick reflexes!

- Restarting: Once a player wins, the scoreboard will show the victor for 3 seconds before the match automatically resets for a new game.

Pro Tips
Anticipate the Bounce: Since the ball gains speed with every hit, position yourself early.

Stay Focused: The physics are precise. Use the edges of your paddle to send the ball back with different trajectories.

Good luck and have fun!
